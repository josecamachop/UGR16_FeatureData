# UGR16 Feature data 

This repository contains the four feature data variants of UGR'16 used in the following papers:

- Camacho, Wasielewska, Espinosa, Fuentes-Garcia. Quality In / Quality Out: Data quality more relevant than model choice in anomaly detection with the UGR'16. IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium. Miami, USA. 2023. 

- Camacho, Rodriguez-Gomez. Data quality tools to optimize a benchmark on anomaly detection. Data, 2024.

Please, make sure to reference the last paper when using the data, and also the original paper of UGR'16:

- Macia-Fernandez, G., Camacho, J., Magan-Carrion, R., Garci≠a-Teodoro, P., Theron, R. Ugr'16: a new dataset for the evaluation of cyclostationarity-based network IDSs. Computer & Security, 2018, 73: 411-424.

Data is provided in Malab format, csv format and excel format.

The original UGR'16 can be downloaded from https://nesg.ugr.es/nesg-ugr16/index.php

A new version with updated nfcapd format can be found at https://codas.ugr.es/animalicos/en/results#datasets

## Repository organization

The folder is organized as follows:

- folder csv: Contains the feature data in csv format.

- folder excel: Contains the feature data in excelformat.

- folder matlab: Contains the feature data in Matlab format.

Each of the datasets contains the training data (X-train), the training labelling (Y-train), the test data (X-test) and the test labelling (Y-test).
